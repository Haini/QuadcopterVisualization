BUILDING
========
For those interested in building from source, follow these steps:

1. Unpack v-collide-2.01.tar.gz.
2. Follow their instructions for building V-Collide to get VCollide.lib and RAPID.lib.
3. Copy VCollide.lib, RAPID.lib, and VCollide.H (from the V-Collide source) into a directory with coldetect.cpp.
4. Inside Matlab, run "mex coldetect.cpp VCollide.lib RAPID.lib".
5. After Matlab compiles coldetect, you should have a binary called coldetect.mex* (the rest of the file extension  depends upon the target system; for Win32 it will be coldetect.mexw32).

See the Matlab documentation on MEX files for further information.

RUNNING
=======

T = COLDETECT(TRI1, TRI2, TRANS1, TRANS2) returns the index of the first transformation that involves a collision between two objects. The two objects are defined by the triangles specified in TRI1 and TRI2. The matrices TRI1 and TRI2 have nine columns, defining the vertices of the triangles (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3). The matrices TRANS1 and TRANS2 define the transformations of objects. They both have twelve columns and have the same number of rows. Each row (e1, ..., e12) defines a single transformation matrix:

[ e4  e5  e6 e1]
[ e7  e8  e9 e2]
[e10 e11 e12 e3]
[  0   0   0  1]
